        <p class="review-content">I ordered a rose gold butterfly cake for my mother's 80th birthday party..the
           cake was delivered on the stated day, beautifully packed and with instructions on how to assemble. The 
           only slight issue we had was that no icing glue was included (3 of us looked thoroughly for it) but we 
           were still able to put the cake together so that it looked just like the picture.
          The cake itself was beautiful, light and tasty and enjoyed by everyone. I will definitely use The Cake 
          Store in future.</p>

        <h3 class="review-title">Not Bad, But Could Be Better</h3>
        <p class="review-content">I was a bit apprehensive ordering from here after seeing the very mixed reviews,
           however, I had an email from sarah asking if I would like the order on the day of my daughters birthday
            as it was a bank holiday and they would be fresher and last longer. She even made sure they were 
            delivered before 1030am on her birthday and answered my phone call and email very efficiently the day 
            before too, regarding some queries I had. My daughter said it was the best cake ever and the sponge was 
            second to none. Someone said about the figures you add looking like they were from Poundland, I care to
             disagree. It was all packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition also with nutritional advice 
             and how to stack it together etc. I will definitely be ordering again. Thank you</p>

        <h3 class="review-title">WonderFul Cake!</h3>
        <p class="review-content">Ordered a 25th birthday cake for my daughter, to be sent to an Airbnb in 
          Derbyshire. As it was to go to a huge house on a country lane I was delighted the courier found it! 
          It looked exactly as I had hoped. Perfectly decorated and in perfect condition. I have been assured that 
          it was "the best sponge cake ever"..a huge compliment from my daughter. All 17 guests also loved it.
           Cannot recommend this company and service highly enough. A big 'Thank you' to The Cake Store.</p>

        <h3 class="review-title">The best Cake</h3>
        <p class="review-content">The best cake! My sister ordered a wedding cake with cupcakes for my wedding, after
           having ordered a birthday cake from the cake store previously and being impressed. We were not disappointed!
            The main cake was lemon drizzle and it was so light and tasty. The cupcakes were a mixture of chocolate and
             vanilla and were gorgeous. Everything was beautifully decorated. It all came well packaged with step by 
             step instructions of how to put it together. We are still getting compliments about the cake several weeks
              on. I can't recommend this store enough for mail order cake</p>

        <h3 class="review-title">Birthday Cake</h3>
        <p class="review-content">I order a birthday cake in October for delivery in November. The cake arrived on the
           date request in excellent condition. The cake was very moist with just a thin layer of icing and tasted 
           absolutely lovely, all my guests without exception really enjoyed it. Thanks The Cake Store, I will 
           definitely use you again.</p>
